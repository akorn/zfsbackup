This directory can be used as a template for /etc/rsyncd on the zfsbackup
server.

It includes a `Makefile` to auto-generate an rsyncd.conf based on the contents
of conf.d/. The alternative approach is to have `&include conf.d` in `rsyncd.conf`.

The `Makefile` won't overwrite an `rsynd.conf` that has such an `&include`
line.

Suggested layout of conf.d/: top level directory should contain files that
make up the global section of rsyncd.conf. You can (and should) use
subdirectories to group rsync modules; at the very least, have one subdir
per client, and in each of those directories, one file per filesystem (with
both the backup and restore module in it). You can make the structure as
deep as you want (e.g. have hostgroups, or groups of fileystems, whatever).

Be aware, though, that the `&include` keyword is not recursive; if you use
several levels of directories, you need a file in each to include the
contents of subdirectories.

On the whole, using a `make`-generated config file is more convenient unless
your config directory is flat.
